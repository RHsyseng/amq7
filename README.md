# AMQ 7 Reference Architecture

This reference architecture demonstrates basic messaging patterns with single-broker, clustered, and fault-tolerant _Red Hat JBoss AMQ 7_ topologies, as well as direct, closest, balanced and 
multicast Interconnect routing configurations.

## Overview
Based on the upstream _Apache ActiveMQ_ and _Apache Qpid_ community projects, _Red Hat JBoss AMQ 7_ is a lightweight, standards-based open source messaging platform designed to enable real-time 
communication between different applications, services, devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It also serves as the messaging foundation for *Red Hat JBoss Fuse*, Red Hatâ€™s lightweight, 
flexible integration platform, and is designed to provide the real-time, distributed messaging capabilities needed to support an agile integration approach for modern application development.

AMQ 7 introduces technology enhancements across three core components: the broker, clients, and Interconnect router.

###  Broker
The AMQ 7 broker, based on _Apache ActiveMQ Artemis_, manages connections, queues, topics, and subscriptions. The new broker has an asynchronous internal architecture which can increase 
performance and scalability and enable it to handle more concurrent connections and achieve greater message throughput. AMQ 7 Broker is a full-featured, message-oriented middleware broker. It 
offers specialized queueing behaviors, message persistence, and manageability. Core messaging is provided with support for different messaging patterns such as publish-subscribe, point-to-point, 
and store-and-forward. AMQ 7 supports multiple protocols and client languages, allowing integration of many, if not all, application assets.

###  Clients
AMQ 7 expands its support of popular messaging APIs and protocols by adding new client libraries, including Java Message Service (JMS) 2.0, JavaScript, C++, .Net, and Python. With existing 
support for the popular open protocols MQTT and AMQP, AMQ 7 now offers broad interoperability across the IT landscape that can open up data in embedded devices to inspection, analysis, and control.

### Interconnect
The new *Interconnect* router in AMQ 7 enables users to create an internet-scale network of uniformly-addressed messaging paths spanning data centers, cloud services, and geographic zones. The 
interconnect component serves as the backbone for distributed messaging, providing redundant network pathing for fault handling, traffic optimization, and more secure and reliable connectivity.

## Project Components

A fully-functional environment is provided for showcasing the various features and topologies mentioned above.

### S2I Image

The [S2I-Base-Image directory](/S2I-Base-Image) supplies a base build image & accompanying template set for establishing an environment on OpenShift Container Platform featuring single-broker, symmetric, 
fault-tolerant, and brokerless Interconnect topologies.

### Test Suite 

The [Test-Suite directory](Test-Suite) supplies a maven-based project housing a test suite that will showcase the various topologies available after building an OpenShift environment from the provided S2I 
base image and templates.
